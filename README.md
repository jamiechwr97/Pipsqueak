# Pipsqueak
Fullstack MERN app created to replicate a social media website as a personal project using React, MongoDB, MUI, etc.

To be able to use this app locally, you will need to first create a database in MongoDB. There is a data file in the "server" folder that will help to fill out the data base first time with a few users and posts, just run the "nodemon index.js" command in the terminal to add the data to your local DB. In the file .env you'll need to add the username and password to your MongoDB database to be able to access.

On the otherhand, to run this app locally, you'll also need to npm i he client folder that contains the frontend of the app, and then npm run start to oepen it up on a local server.
